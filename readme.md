Fresh Made easy allows customers to customize food boxes for pickup from locations close to their homes with food from local farms and vendors around the Nashville area. The Google Maps API allows users to view pickup locations are around them, and see where locally an item has been sourced from. User's can choose to shop by category or by vendor, and upon checkout can choose their preferred pickup location and date that works best for them.

## About Me

Leah has made her way to the tech industry in a bit of an untraditional way. She began working in kitchens in 2008  and since then has climbed the ladder in the culinary industry, cooking at a Five-Star hotel, and ultimately becoming the Executive Chef over a popular Nashville brewery's restaurant and event space. Over the course of working her way up in the hospitality scene, her role became more and more focused on problem solving--something that excited her. After an unforeseen global pandemic flipped the culinary scene on its head, and taking JavaScript up as a hobby during quarantine, she's looking to take her love of technology and problem solving to the next level and pursue a career in software engineering.
